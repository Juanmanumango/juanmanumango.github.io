## Experience in Data Analysis
**Object Detection and Image Recognition:**

[Building Damage Detection in San Juan, Puerto Rico](https://github.com/Juanmanumango/juanmanumango.github.io/blob/main/portfolio/python/building_damage_detection_in_san_juan_puerto_rico.ipynb)

Participated in EY and NASA’s Open Science Data Challenge to develop an object detection model using **YOLO v8**, aimed at identifying damaged residential and commercial buildings in San Juan, Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.  

**Classification Modeling:**

[Low Birthweight Classification](https://github.com/Juanmanumango/juanmanumango.github.io/blob/main/portfolio/python/low_birthweight_classification.ipynb)

Developed a predictive classification model utilizing **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** algorithms to identify potential instances of low birthweight from parental data. This model aids in early intervention strategies, potentially reducing health risks associated with low birthweight.

**Regression Modeling:**

[Regression modeling to Predict Amount of Clicks](https://github.com/juanmendezportet/data_analyst.github.io/blob/main/portfolio/python/regression_model_clicks_predictions.ipynb)

Utilized **data imputation** and **feature engineering** techniques, along with a **Decision Tree Regressor**, to accurately forecast click rates for an Air France marketing campaign.
